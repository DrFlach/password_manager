   - 24 hours (default)

3. Click **Create Link**

4. Copy the generated link and share it securely (e.g., via encrypted messaging)

5. **Important**: The link can only be opened **once** and expires automatically

### Viewing a Shared Password

2. The password is displayed **once** and the link is destroyed

3. Copy the password and store it securely

## 🔧 API Reference

### Backend Endpoints

## 🔐 Security Features

### Client-Side Encryption

All passwords are encrypted using **AES-GCM** (256-bit) before being stored in `localStorage`.

- **Encryption key** - Generated once per browser and stored locally
- **Random IV** - Each encryption uses a unique initialization vector
- **No server access** - Your master key never leaves your browser

### Share Link Security

1. **Cryptographically secure tokens** - 32 bytes of random data (256 bits)
2. **One-time use** - Links are destroyed after first view
3. **Automatic expiration** - Links expire after specified time
4. **Encrypted transit** - Passwords are encrypted during sharing
5. **No persistence** - Shared passwords are deleted after viewing

### Best Practices

- **Backup your passwords** - Export data regularly (localStorage only)
- **Use strong master passwords** - Protect your password manager access
- **Verify share recipients** - Only share links via secure channels
- **Regular cleanup** - Delete old, unused passwords

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables before starting the backend:

```bash
# Port (default: 8080)
export PORT=8080

# Base URL for share links (default: http://localhost:8080)
export BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Run the server
cd backend
go run main.go handlers.go models.go
```

### Production Deployment

For production:

1. **Set BASE_URL** to your production domain:
   ```bash
   export BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Enable HTTPS** - Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy) with SSL/TLS

3. **Restrict CORS** - Update `corsMiddleware` in `main.go` to only allow your frontend domain

4. **Build the Go binary**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   go build -o password-manager
   ./password-manager
   ```

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors

Edit the Tailwind config in `index.html`:

```javascript
tailwind.config = {
    theme: {
        extend: {
            colors: {
                primary: {
                    DEFAULT: '#7C3AED',  // Change these
                    dark: '#6B46C1',
                    light: '#A78BFA',
                },
                // ... more colors
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend not starting

**Error**: `address already in use`

**Solution**: Another process is using port 8080. Change the port:
```bash
export PORT=3000
go run main.go handlers.go models.go
```

### Passwords won't decrypt

**Cause**: Your encryption key may have been cleared or changed.

**Solution**: Unfortunately, encrypted passwords cannot be recovered without the original key. Start fresh by clearing localStorage:
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.clear()
```

### Share links not working

**Cause**: Backend is not running or wrong API URL.

**Solution**: 
1. Ensure backend is running: `http://localhost:8080/api/health`
2. Check `apiBaseUrl` in `app.js` matches your backend URL

### CORS errors

**Cause**: Frontend domain doesn't match allowed origins.

**Solution**: Update the `corsMiddleware` in `backend/main.go` to include your domain.
